## Background

In today's workplace, essential information is often scattered across the cloud in the form of links. We understand the frustration of endlessly searching through emails, messages, and websites just to find the right link. Links are notorious for being unwieldy, complex, and easily lost in the shuffle. Remembering and sharing them can be a challenge.

That's why we developed Slash, a solution that transforms these links into easily accessible, discoverable, and shareable shortcuts(e.g., `s/shortcut`). Say goodbye to link chaos and welcome the organizational ease of Slash into your daily online workflow.
